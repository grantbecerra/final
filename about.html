    <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
    <p style="background-color: #C0C0C0">At Dolan Lawn and landscape our main goal is to bring the best posible service to our customers for a fair price.
<br>
Our experience allows us to do a great job, every time. For years, we have been the area’s go-to source for lawn care and maintenance, and that’s a mantle we intend on carrying on into future generations. When this lawn care business started, we only had the minimal resources most small businesses get. Now our name is well-known, but we still have the same amount of care and quality service that we always prided ourselves on.
